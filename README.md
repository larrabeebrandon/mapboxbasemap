#### Objective: :cupid:
The goal of this lab was to create a Valentines day themed base map using the website [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) that was first introduced to us by Rafa last week. I used the theme Icecream provided by mapbox and focused in on Corvallis to further personalize the base map. I used a visual hierarchy to change the fonts, sizes and colors of labels as well as polygons and chose warm colors (pink-red) and fonts that I deemed as "fun".
